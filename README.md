## 🔒 Security Features

### 1. Database Encryption

- Uses **Hive** with `HiveAesCipher` — the entire `.hive` file on disk is AES-256 encrypted
- Even if an attacker extracts the app's data folder, they only see random bytes
- The DB encryption key is generated on first run and stored in Android Keystore / iOS Keychain via `flutter_secure_storage`

### 2. AES-256 Field Encryption

- The `secretNote` field of every task is encrypted with AES-256-CBC via the `encrypt` package
- Even within the app, notes are stored as Base64 ciphertext — decrypted only when the user views them
- AES key and IV are stored in hardware-backed secure storage (never hardcoded)

### 3. Biometric Authentication

- Uses `local_auth` for fingerprint / Face ID login
- Prerequisite: user must have logged in with a password at least once
- Fallback to password login always available

### 4. Auto-Logout (Session Timeout)

- A 2-minute inactivity timer runs whenever the user is logged in
- Every screen touch (detected by a root-level `Listener` widget) resets the timer
- On timeout: user is automatically logged out and redirected to the login screen

### 5. Hardware-Backed Key Storage

- All encryption keys are stored using `flutter_secure_storage`
- Android: Android Keystore (hardware security module)
- iOS: Keychain with `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`
- Keys are **never** hardcoded or stored in SharedPreferences

### 6. Privacy Protection (Bonus)

- `flutter_windowmanager` with `FLAG_SECURE` prevents:
  - Screenshots of the app
  - App content appearing in the Android Recent Apps switcher (blurred)

### 7. MFA / OTP (Bonus)

- 6-digit OTP screen shown after registration
- Simulated for demo (real implementation would use Firebase Extensions or Twilio)

## 🚀 Setup & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate Hive adapters
flutter pub run build_runner build

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Email/Password authentication
3. Download `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
4. Place them in `android/app/` and `ios/Runner/` respectively
